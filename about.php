To start using inWheel, you will have to sign up and cerate your account. Each user has his or her own inWheel to maintain. You can add other people to your inWheel by following them. By doing so, you will be able to view all the posts and pictures uploaded by them, describing their travel experience to a particular place. Users can maintain their profile by updating posts about the various places that they have visited. A user can get to know more about a new place to visit in two ways, by either viewing posts of the people they follow or by searching for a specific destination they have in mind. Our main goal inWheel is to make the travelling experience of any enthusiast as enriching as possible, by allowing them to interact with others who have visited the same place before.</h4>
